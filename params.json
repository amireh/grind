It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"grind","body":"# What it is\r\n\r\ngrind is a tool that helps you extract information stored in your application \r\nlog files, and gives you the ability to reformat that data or view a subset of\r\nit at any time.\r\n\r\nLog files could get messy, and when your software matures and gets deployed on\r\nproduction servers it becomes a daunting task to find out what's going on. Even\r\nif there's only a single rotating log file, grind saves your time by making it\r\neasy to reach any kind information you're after.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* View and analyze logs from different applications across multiple servers from a single, unified interface\r\n* Utmost flexibility thanks to grind being completely [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org)-driven\r\n* Easy to configure; grind uses [Lua](http://www.lua.org), internally and for configuration, with super-clean syntax\r\n* Archiving of formatted data for offline querying or history backtracking\r\n* Bandwidth-efficient; nothing is transmitted except for what you're currently viewing\r\n* Filtering system that allows you to control exactly what you want to receive at any time\r\n* Horizontal and vertical parsing; pieces of data can be extracted not only from a single message, but from several ones too\r\n* Completely free and open source!\r\n* Ready examples for popular applications like Apache httpd, Ruby on Rails, Ogre3D, and CEGUI\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\nFirst you need to get grind [installed](https://github.com/amireh/grind/wiki/Installing-grind)\r\nand [configured](https://github.com/amireh/grind/wiki/Configuring-grind). After that, you should\r\ntake a look at its [structure](https://github.com/amireh/grind/wiki/Grind-overview) to get briefed\r\non some terminology and how things work. Afterwards, go through the\r\n[tutorials](https://github.com/amireh/grind/wiki/Tutorial-1:-Birth-of-the-chimp) for a good look at\r\nusing grind's features, or if you're really impatient, check out the\r\n[5-minute](https://github.com/amireh/grind/wiki/The-5-minute-crash-course) tutorial.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License - Copyright (c) 2011-2012 Ahmad Amireh","google":"UA-15596792-4"}
